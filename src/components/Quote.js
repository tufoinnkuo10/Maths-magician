    Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithm:
    It is about understanding- Williams Paul Thurston.
    <br />
    <br />
    Without mathematics, there’s nothing you can do. Everything around you is mathematics.
    Everything around you is numbers.
    — Shakuntala Devi,
    <br />
    <br />
    As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain,
    and as far as they are certain,they do not refer to reality.
    — Albert Einstein
